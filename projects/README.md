# Projects Directory

This directory contains project-specific documentation organized by project slug. Each project in your Kito workspace gets its own subdirectory with required `instructions/` and `notes/` directories where you have complete freedom to organize your content.

## Directory Structure

```
projects/
 README.md                    # This file  
 {project-slug}/              # Individual project directories (match Kito entity slugs)
     instructions/            # Project-specific instructions (put anything here)
     notes/                   # Project-specific notes (put anything here)
```

## Key Points

- **Required Structure**: Kito enforces the `{project-slug}/instructions/` and `{project-slug}/notes/` directory structure
- **Content Freedom**: You can put **anything** you want inside these directories
- **Organization Freedom**: Organize content hierarchically, flat, or any way that works for you
- **System-managed Slugs**: Directory names correspond to project slugs generated by Kito (cannot be changed)
- **Auto-creation**: Missing directories are automatically created when you add projects to your workspace
- **Health Monitoring**: Use workspace settings health check to detect and fix structural issues
- **Other Files Ignored**: You can have other files in the repository, but Kito will not process them

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Do not delete the required `instructions/` and `notes/` directories themselves, but feel free to create any content within them.

## Content Guidelines

Here's the conceptual difference between the directories:

### Instructions Directory
**Conceptual Purpose**: Project-specific guidance and workflows that AI assistants should follow

**Content Types** (organize however you prefer):
- **Rules**: Project-specific coding standards and conventions (e.g., "Use conventional commits," "Require PR reviews for main branch")
- **Workflows**: Step-by-step procedures for deployment, testing, development processes with automation logic
- **Guidelines**: Architecture principles, team conventions, technical constraints
- **Best Practices**: Project-specific development patterns and standards

### Notes Directory
**Conceptual Purpose**: Project specifications, documentation, and knowledge

**Content Types** (organize however you prefer):
- **Specifications**: Project requirements, goals, feature descriptions, user stories
- **Architecture**: System design, technical decisions, database schemas, API specifications  
- **Documentation**: Research notes, onboarding guides, background context, decision records
- **Planning**: Project roadmaps, brainstorming notes, analysis, and strategic thinking

## Organization Examples

You have complete freedom in how you organize content within these directories:

### By Development Phase
```
instructions/
  planning/
    requirements-gathering.md
    architecture-decisions.md
  development/
    coding-standards.md
    review-process.md
  deployment/
    staging-workflow.md
    production-checklist.md
  
notes/
  specifications/
    user-stories.md
    technical-requirements.md
  architecture/
    system-design.md
    database-schema.md
  research/
    technology-evaluation.md
    competitive-analysis.md
```

### By Feature Area
```
instructions/
  frontend-rules.md
  backend-rules.md
  deployment.md
  testing.md
  
notes/
  frontend-architecture.md
  backend-architecture.md
  api-specification.md
  database-design.md
```

### Flat Organization
```
instructions/
  project-rules.md
  workflows.md
  deployment.md
  
notes/
  specification.md
  architecture.md
  research.md
```

### Custom Organization
Organize in whatever way makes sense for your project - the structure is entirely up to you!

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What Works Now
- **Directory Creation**: Kito automatically creates missing project directories with required subdirectories
- **Structure Validation**: Ensures each project has proper `instructions/` and `notes/` directories
- **Health Monitoring**: Workspace settings can detect and fix structural discrepancies
- **Content Freedom**: Put any files you want inside the required directories

### üöß Future Development
- **Content Synchronization**: File content sync between Kito web UI and GitHub repository
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Export project rules to different AI coding tools
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for project specification management
- **Context Export**: Project context available for AI assistants through Kito CLI
- **Workflow Automation**: Integration with CI/CD systems and task runners

## Project Lifecycle Management

### Initialization (Current & Planned)
- Create project directories automatically when you add projects to your workspace
- Organize initial content however works best for your project
- Use any structure that fits your development methodology

### Development (Planned)
- Update specifications and documentation as your project evolves
- Maintain version control through standard git workflows
- Collaborate through multiple editing interfaces (Kito UI, GitHub, local git)

### Maintenance (Planned)  
- Keep documentation current with system changes
- Archive obsolete specifications using git history
- Update procedures as your deployment and development processes evolve

## Best Practices

### Content Management
- **Keep specifications current**: Update requirements as the project evolves
- **Document decisions**: Record the rationale behind architectural choices
- **Maintain workflows**: Keep deployment and development procedures accurate and tested
- **Use version control**: Leverage git history to track specification evolution

### Repository Health
- **Don't delete required directories**: Keep `instructions/` and `notes/` directories intact
- **Use health check**: Regularly check workspace settings for structural issues
- **Experiment freely**: Try different organizational approaches within the directories

### Future Collaboration Features
- **Multi-source Editing**: Eventually edit through Kito web UI, GitHub interface, or local git operations
- **Review Processes**: Use standard git workflows for collaborative editing
- **Stakeholder Integration**: Include team members and stakeholders in documentation discussions
- **Conflict Resolution**: Kito will provide tools to resolve editing conflicts when content sync is implemented

## Future AI Assistant Integration

When implemented, project instructions will serve as canonical specifications that Kito will translate for different AI coding tools:

- **Project-specific rules**: Export to `.claude/settings.json`, `.cursorrules`, etc.
- **Workflow automation**: Integration with task runners and CI/CD systems
- **Context export**: Make project context available for AI assistants through Kito CLI and MCP server

---

**Note:** These are conceptual guidelines to help you think about different types of information. You have complete freedom to organize and structure your content in whatever way works best for your project. The key insight is that instructions are meant for AI assistants to follow, while notes contain the knowledge and context about your project. But the specific organization within each directory is entirely up to you.
