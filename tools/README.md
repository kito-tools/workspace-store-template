# Tools Directory

This directory contains tool-specific documentation organized by tool slug. Each tool in your Kito workspace gets its own subdirectory with required `instructions/` and `notes/` directories where you have complete freedom to organize your content.

## Directory Structure

```
tools/
 README.md                    # This file
 {tool-slug}/                 # Individual tool directories (match Kito entity slugs)
     instructions/            # Tool-specific instructions (put anything here)
     notes/                   # Tool-specific notes (put anything here)
```

## Key Points

- **Required Structure**: Kito enforces the `{tool-slug}/instructions/` and `{tool-slug}/notes/` directory structure
- **Content Freedom**: You can put **anything** you want inside these directories
- **Organization Freedom**: Organize content hierarchically, flat, or any way that works for you
- **System-managed Slugs**: Directory names correspond to tool slugs generated by Kito (cannot be changed)
- **Auto-creation**: Missing directories are automatically created when you add tools to your workspace
- **Health Monitoring**: Use workspace settings health check to detect and fix structural issues
- **Other Files Ignored**: You can have other files in the repository, but Kito will not process them

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Do not delete the required `instructions/` and `notes/` directories themselves, but feel free to create any content within them.

## Content Guidelines

Here's the conceptual difference between the directories:

### Instructions Directory
**Conceptual Purpose**: Guidance and automation that AI assistants should follow

**Content Types** (organize however you prefer):
- **Rules**: System-level guidance and preferences (e.g., "Always use TypeScript strict mode," "Follow this import order")
- **Workflows**: Step-by-step procedures for repetitive tasks, with automation logic (e.g., "To deploy the service, first run tests, then build the container, then push to the registry")
- **Best Practices**: Development guidelines, coding standards, and team conventions

### Notes Directory  
**Conceptual Purpose**: Documentation, context, and knowledge about the tool

**Content Types** (organize however you prefer):
- **Overview**: What the tool does, why it's useful, and how to use it
- **Documentation**: Setup instructions, configuration options, usage examples
- **Context**: Background knowledge, troubleshooting guides, research findings
- **Specifications**: Technical details, requirements, and constraints

## Organization Examples

You have complete freedom in how you organize content within these directories:

### Hierarchical Organization
```
instructions/
  development/
    coding-standards.md
    testing-guidelines.md
  deployment/
    staging-workflow.md
    production-checklist.md
  
notes/
  setup/
    installation.md
    configuration.md
  examples/
    basic-usage.md
    advanced-features.md
```

### Flat Organization
```
instructions/
  rules.md
  workflows.md
  deployment.md
  
notes/
  overview.md
  examples.md
  troubleshooting.md
```

### Custom Organization
Organize in whatever way makes sense for your workflow - the structure is entirely up to you!

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What Works Now
- **Directory Creation**: Kito automatically creates missing tool directories with required subdirectories
- **Structure Validation**: Ensures each tool has proper `instructions/` and `notes/` directories
- **Health Monitoring**: Workspace settings can detect and fix structural discrepancies
- **Content Freedom**: Put any files you want inside the required directories

### üöß Future Development
- **Content Synchronization**: File content sync between Kito web UI and GitHub repository
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Export instructions to different AI coding tools
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for managing tool documentation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle simultaneous edits from multiple sources

## Best Practices

### Content Management
- **Keep instructions actionable**: Write guidance that AI assistants can follow
- **Make notes comprehensive**: Document context that helps understand the tool
- **Use consistent formatting**: Follow markdown best practices for readability
- **Reference external docs**: Link to official documentation when appropriate

### Repository Health
- **Don't delete required directories**: Keep `instructions/` and `notes/` directories intact
- **Use health check**: Regularly check workspace settings for structural issues
- **Experiment freely**: Try different organizational approaches within the directories

### Future Collaboration
- **Version Control**: Full git history will be maintained for all content changes
- **Multi-source Editing**: Eventually edit through Kito web UI, GitHub interface, or local git operations
- **Conflict Resolution**: Kito will provide tools to resolve editing conflicts when content sync is implemented

**Note:** These are conceptual guidelines - you have complete freedom to organize and structure your content in whatever way works best for your workflow. The distinction between instructions and notes is to help you think about different types of information, but the organization within each directory is entirely up to you.
